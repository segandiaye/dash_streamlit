# Hand on streamlit

A simple example using Streamlit, numpy, plotly and Matplotlib, created during my data science internship at [Artefact School](https://schoolofdata.artefact.com/).

# Run

```bash
git clone git@github.com:segandiaye/dash_streamlit.git
cd dash_streamlit
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

# Deployment

- Create your GitHub repository.
- Clone your repository locally.
- Copy the entire `dash_streamlit` folder into your repository directory.
- Run `git add .` to stage all changes.
- Run `git commit -m "Streamlit deployment"` to commit your changes.
- Go to [streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io) and follow the deployment steps. If everything is set up correctly, you should see something like the demo below.
